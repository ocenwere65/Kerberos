I used the Java programming language when constructing the program. For socket programming, user input, and scanner, I imported the java.io and java.util libraries. For the encryption/decryption implementation, I imported the java.crypto and java.security libraries. And Lastly, to declare/initialize the TS and Instant values, I imported the time libraries.
The IDE I used was Netbeans.
I approached the construction of this project in a step by step process. As laid out in the instructions, I first declared and initialized the variable, such as the keys (using DES), the TS values, the IDs, and the Sockets, and established the connections between the Client and both Server 1 and Server 2. For each part, I concatenated the designated variables, encrypted them, and sent the ciphertext to the destined server where the text is decrypted (using shared Keys) and the plaintext is printed out. I also extracted any tickets concatenated in the plaintext to validate whether the ticket has expired. (Similar in previous labs, before sending the ciphertext, I converted the encryption (in bytes) to hex format and de-converted the text on the opposite end). There was a brief conflict trying to connect to the second server while simultaneously connected to another server but I resolved the issue with a few edits. To run the code, you first run the Client (that starts the socket connection) followed by Server 1 (which serves as both AS and TGS) which will display the necessary information (plaintext, ticket, ticket-validation, etc.). Once Server 1â€™s process is completed, you can run Server 2 (which serves as V) which will display the final part of the program.
